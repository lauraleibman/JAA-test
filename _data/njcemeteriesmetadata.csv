These verses, like Mayhew’s biographies, emphasized the presence of divine Grace in the lives of dead and hence reassured the mourners that the deceased was among the saved. The broadsides were often illustrated with iconography similar to that of gravestones with death’s heads, scythes, hourglasses, and the like (Stannard THE PURITAN WAY OF DEATH 117).
